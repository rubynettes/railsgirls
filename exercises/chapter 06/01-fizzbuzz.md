# Exercise: FizzBuzz

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

Sample output:

```
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
16
17
Fizz
19
Buzz

... upto 100.
```

You will need the following tutorial section for this exercise!

#### Hints

1. Save your code in a file called `fizzbuzz.rb` and execute it in your Terminal application with the command

  ```
    ruby fizzbuzz.rb
  ```



2. To combine two conditions, you can use `&&` like so:
  ```Ruby
    if x >= 10 && x <= 20
      puts "x is between 10 and 20"
    end
  ```
