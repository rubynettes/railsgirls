# Exercise: Connect Four

Here is another game based exercise :-)

Build a command line version of Connect Four ("Vier Gewinnt" in German).

## Rules

The rules, cited from a [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four):

Connect Four is a two-player game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the next available space within the column. The objective of the game is to connect four of one's own discs of the same color next to each other vertically, horizontally, or diagonally before your opponent.

## The Program

The program prints the board. A user enter which column she wants to place a stone in, and your program will put the stone at the correct position and print the new board. Also, your program should detect the winner.

## Color

Bonus points for colored output! You can use this gem: https://github.com/fazibear/colorize
